# Issues

Known faults and gaps that are not being worked on right now, so that they are
written down somewhere other than a conversation.

This is for things that are *wrong* or *missing*, not for design questions,
which belong in a plan or a design doc. An entry says what breaks, what it
costs, what it would take, and whether it has been reproduced or only reasoned
about -- the last of those matters, and entries should say so plainly.

Remove an entry when it is fixed. A fixed issue lives in the commit that fixed
it and in whatever doc describes the working thing; it does not need a second
home here.

## Inlining drops a call's shape descriptors, and nothing but a test inlines

**Reproduced**, but only through a dispatcher nothing outside the test suite
constructs. Recorded together because the second half decides what to do about
the first.

`RemapContext::remap_instruction` blanks `shape_descriptors` when it copies a
`Call` into the body it is inlining into. That is half right: a
`DescriptorRef::Own(i)` indexes the *enclosing* function's declared shapes and
means nothing once the body has moved, so keeping it would be wrong. A
`DescriptorRef::Static(ty)` is a whole type and is valid anywhere, and blanking
throws it away. The callee is then entered with no descriptor:

```datalove
fun wrap<T>(x: T): [T]
    var out: [T] = [x]
    ret out
end fun

fun wrap_s(x: string): [string]     // concrete, so it declares no shapes,
    ret wrap(x)                     // but this call carries a static one
end fun

fun hot(): [string]
    ret wrap_s("s")
end fun
```

Calling `hot` past the inline threshold puts `wrap_s`'s body inside it without
the descriptor, and the interpreter panics on `a shape built with is one this
function declared`, leaks 86 bytes and aborts in the destructor.

`ListNew`, `SetNew` and `MapNew` carry a `descriptor: Some(i)` index with the
same problem, copied verbatim into a function with a different shape list. That
one is not reachable: a body containing one belongs to a function that declares
shapes, and a call to such a function is never offered to a dispatcher -- the
interpreter keeps it, and `bridge::dispatchable` refuses it at the other end --
so it is never inlined. Only the `Static` blanking is live.

**Nothing inlines outside tests.** `DynamicInliner` is constructed in exactly
one place, `OptimizingDispatcher::with_config`, and `OptimizingDispatcher` is
constructed in exactly two, both test binaries. `datalove script --jit` builds a
bare `JitEngine`; the REPL, the benches and `worldfile_analysis` pass no
dispatcher at all. So the inliner has never run in anything a user can invoke.

The other inliner, the directive-driven `datalove-datafun-inline` API --
`parse_inline_directives`, `inline_module`, `inline_cross_module`, and the
`inline-directives` worldfile section -- is reachable only from
`ir_inline_tests`, which compares printed IR before and against after and never
*runs* the result. 21 fixtures, none generic.

What does run is the two dispatch suites, over the 407 worldfiles in
`fixtures/interp`: 5 inlinings in tuned mode, 125 in chaos mode, checked by
comparing against the plain interpreter. None of those 407 mentions a type
parameter, which is why this was never seen.

**Worth knowing before fixing either.** An inlined body is picked up in
`execute_call`, when the function is *entered*, so an inlining performed during
an invocation does not affect that invocation -- only a later call to the same
caller. A hot loop inside a single call never benefits from inlining its
callees. That is what makes the feature much weaker than the thresholds
suggest, and it is worth deciding whether the inliner earns its place at all
before spending anything on the descriptor handling.

## No table module, and none can be written

**Investigated, not a fault.** A table is a first-class opaque value: built,
moved, cloned, compared, sorted, keyed on, held inside anything
(`std_tests/144_table_shapes`). What nothing does is look inside one -- no cell
accessor, no row count, no push or pop -- and no module could add them. Two
things stop one being written.

Note that `ord` already reaches tables: `ord.compare` and `ord.equal` take one,
because the comparison walks a value from its descriptor, so `ord.sorted`,
`ord.contains` and the rest work over a `[{| ... |}]`. Whole-table operations
are not the gap.

**There is no way to say "any table".** Tables *are* generic per column --
`fun ident<T>(t: {| x: T, y: u32 |})` compiles and runs, and
`bind_type_params` unifies two table types column by column. What cannot be
written is a signature whose *column list* is not fixed: a type parameter
stands for a column's type, and nothing stands for the set of columns.

```datalove
fun len(ref self: ???): index    // nothing goes in the hole
```

The same hole stops the **native** being declared, which is why this is not
merely a missing library. Writing it over a bare `T` instead would accept a
list or a string just as readily and read their bytes as a table's.

**A column's type varies by column.** `dtlv_rti_table_get_local` takes a row
and a column and hands back a raw pointer, because there is no one type to
hand back. A `get(ref self, row, col)` has no return type to write: the answer
depends on `col`, which is a value. So even a module written for one concrete
table type could not have a general `get`; it would need one accessor per
column, which is what column projection syntax (`t.x`) would give.

**What exists underneath.** The runtime has `table_create`, `table_destroy`,
`table_push_row`, `table_build_from_rows`, `table_get`, `table_set`,
`table_clear` and `table_len`, none of them reachable from the language. The
spec mentions column projections yielding a list view; `t.x` is
`ProjectionOnNonAggregate` today, and `t[i]?` is refused because indexing wants
a list, map or tensor.

Because nothing reaches `table_push_row`, a table's row count is whatever was
written in the literal that made it, so a table cannot be built from data at
all.

**What it would take** is worked through in
[Tables: what the type system is missing](design-table-rows.md). The short of
it: column projection first, which needs no type-system change and is already
specified -- and which is cheap because the storage is columnar, so a column
view is a well-formed list header pointing into the table. Then a row type, so
that `table R` makes the row an ordinary parameter and the natives writable.

**The tensor module went the other way** and is written, because a tensor's
element *is* a type parameter -- `[|T, 1|]` -- even though its rank is not. See
`sys/std/tensor.dfm`.

## A unit that fails part way through leaves its index to the next one

**Reasoned, not reproduced.**

A script unit is registered once it finishes
(`IrInterpreter::execute_script_unit_in_env` calls `env.add_unit` after
execution, and returns early on error). So a unit that runs far enough to leave
something behind -- an inlined body in the dispatcher, a JIT entry -- and then
errors is never registered, and the next unit takes the index it was using.
Anything remembered under that index is then the wrong unit's.

`FuncIdentity` and `FunctionKey::of` key on the unit a local reference belongs
to, and take it from the registry's count, which is the index the running unit
will have. That is the same number the compiler uses for a later unit's
`CodeRef::External`, so the two agree -- as long as a failed unit does not
disturb the counting.

Closing it means the compiler's unit numbering and the runtime's agreeing about
failed units, which `CodeRef::External` already assumes today. Worth examining
as its own question rather than patching the key.

## Inlining never triggers from a caller in an earlier unit

**Known gap, marked in the source.**

`DynamicInliner::dispatch_call` finds the caller to inline into by matching on
its reference, and the `CodeRef::External` arm returns `None` with a TODO. So a
call site in a later unit into an earlier unit's function never triggers
inlining, however hot it gets.

The lookup is available -- `registry.get_external_function_as_unit(unit, id)`
-- so this is about three lines. The half that used to be missing is already
done: `FuncIdentity` folds `Local` and `External` together, so a body optimized
while its unit was current is found when a later unit calls the same function
externally.

## A field of a const cannot be projected, but a const can be destructured

**Reproduced.**

```datalove
const PAIR: (int, int) = (: int / 10, : int / 20)
let a = PAIR.0       // NonCopyFieldProjection
let b = PAIR.0@      // NonCopyFieldProjection as well

const MAYBE: ?int = some :int/42
if MAYBE |val|       // fine: unwraps a fresh copy
    debuglog val
end if
```

So a linear payload may be taken out of a const option and a linear field may
not be taken out of a const tuple, though both are reading one part of a
constant. A const of an aggregate type can therefore be passed along whole and
not read into, which is what `specialize_differential/017_comptime_tuple` means
by "can't destructure tuples yet".

The projection rule exists to stop a non-copy field moving out of a place
someone still holds. Reading a constant is not that: each read materializes its
own copy, which is why reading a const binding does not consume it. Settling
this is a rule about every const rather than about const parameters, which is
why it was left alone while those were being worked on.

Note that `p.a@` on a `let` binding works, since lowering borrows the field and
clones through the borrow. The const path refuses earlier, at typecheck, so it
never reaches that.

## A specialized function keeps an original nobody calls

**By design, and wrong for one of the two cases.**

Const parameter specialization is additive: the original function stays and a
copy per instantiation is added beside it. That is what makes a call site the
pass cannot see -- a script unit's, compiled later -- still have something to
call.

An AOT build has no later script unit. There, a function whose every call site
was specialized keeps an original that nothing reaches, and it is emitted.
Dead-code elimination over the module graph would remove it; nothing does that
today.
